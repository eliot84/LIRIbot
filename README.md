## What is this?

Liribot is a command line interface tool that allows users to make api calls to obtain information from twitter, spotify and omd and records all information requested.

## Purpose

The purpose of this interface tool is to learn to use and integrate various NPM Packages with node including require, fs, node-spotify-api, moment.js, twitter, dotenv, request and inquirer to complete a functional application.
